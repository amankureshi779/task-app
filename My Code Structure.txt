Hello, My name is Aman Kureshi, I have developed this Task-Management Application

Text Editor:- VS Code
Developed using:- Node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, EJS

Using npm package I installed the packages that are required for this app 
dependencies:--> dotenv, ejs, express, mongoose
dev-dependency:--> nodemon 


I have MVC (Model view Controll) Architecture for this application


For User Interface of this application used embedded javascript


I created a config.env file to store my database connection string and password for database connection

I have used mongoose to connect my express application to my mongodb atlas database
I have used mongoose schema for data validation and creating models

CRUD Operations:---->
I have used HTTP method and database query to perform Create, Read, update and Delete operations

To create Task ---> using post method
To read Task  ---> using get method
To update Task ---> used  get to confirm id and then post to update my data
To delete Task ----> used get method 

MongoDB Database Query ----->
find ----> To read all created Task
findByIdAndUpdate ---> To update Task
findByIdAndDelete ---> To delete Task

Error Handling:--> I have used try and catch to handle error

Code Redablity:--->
Separated my code modules(file) according to their reponseblity like main app file separated from server file and other separate file for routes and route handler
